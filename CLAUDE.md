## Git Workflow

- **One PR per feature** — never bundle multiple features into a single PR
- **Always branch from main** — before starting any new task:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git checkout -b claude/<feature-name>
  ```
- **Never push to a previous feature branch** for a new task — always start fresh from main
- **Commit messages** — use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
- **PR per task** — open a dedicated PR immediately after pushing the branch
- **ALWAYS pull main before pushing** — immediately before every `git push`, merge the latest main into the feature branch to avoid conflicts:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin main
  git merge origin/main   # resolve any conflicts, then:
  git push -u origin <branch-name>
  ```

## Project Overview

WealthPath is an **India-first personal finance dashboard and FIRE planning tool**. It is a **read-only monitoring and planning app** — it helps users understand their current financial position, track all their investments in one place, and plan their path to financial independence.

**What it is NOT:**
- Not an investment advisor — no product recommendations, no SEBI registration required
- Not a broker or distributor — no transactions, no order execution
- Not a wealth manager — no custody of funds

**What it IS:**
- A personal finance dashboard: one place to see all investments (MF, EPF, PPF, NPS, equity, FD, real estate, gold)
- A FIRE calculator: tells users how far they are from financial independence
- A tax planner: old vs new regime comparison for their income
- A financial health scorer: 0–100 score across 5 dimensions

Phase 1 is free — manual data entry, FIRE calculations, tax comparison, health score.
Phase 2 adds premium features (₹499/mo · ₹3,999/yr): push notifications, MF import from CAMS/KFintech, demat sync, and Account Aggregator auto-sync.

**Disclaimer present on all projection/estimate screens:** *"For educational purposes only. Not investment advice."*

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Mobile | React Native (Expo SDK 51), TypeScript |
| Backend | NestJS + TypeScript |
| Database | SQLite via Prisma (POC) → PostgreSQL (production) |
| State | Zustand (`authStore`) |
| Navigation | React Navigation v6 — native stack + bottom tabs |

**Paths:**
- `mobile/` — Expo app (port 8081)
- `backend/` — NestJS API (port 3000)

**Key packages (mobile):**
- `axios` — API client with JWT interceptor
- `expo-secure-store` — token storage (with localStorage fallback on web)
- `expo-print` — HTML → PDF conversion
- `expo-sharing` — native share sheet for PDF

        ├── EditFinancials  (income, expenses, EMI, dependents)
        ├── EditGoals       (retirement age, desired income, city, risk)
        ├── EditInvestment  (add or edit a single investment)
        └── Subscription    (plan selection + Razorpay billing)
```

                    /subscriptions/dev-activate (POST — dev only)
```

## POC-Specific Behaviours

### OTP (Dev Mode)
- No SMS gateway. `sendOtp` returns `{ message, devOtp }` when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.
- `OTPVerificationScreen` auto-fills and verifies `devOtp` on mount — zero friction in dev.
- In production: `devOtp` is `undefined`; users enter OTP from SMS normally.

### Premium (Dev Mode)
- No Razorpay account needed in dev. `POST /subscriptions/dev-activate` instantly upgrades the user to premium.
- `SubscriptionScreen` calls `devActivate()` directly in dev. In production, replace with `createOrder()` → Razorpay payment sheet → `verifyPayment()`.
- The endpoint throws `403 Forbidden` in production (`NODE_ENV === 'production'`).
- To gate a new premium endpoint: `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, PremiumGuard)` — `PremiumGuard` is in `backend/src/common/guards/premium.guard.ts`.

### Auth / Storage
- `expo-secure-store` throws on web. All token reads/writes wrapped in try-catch with `localStorage` fallback.
- `isOnboardingComplete` persisted to `localStorage` on web so it survives page reloads.
- Same fallback pattern in both `authStore.ts` and the Axios request interceptor in `api.ts`.

### Database
- SQLite (file `backend/prisma/dev.db`). No Docker required for POC.
- **No enums** in Prisma schema — SQLite doesn't support them. Use `String` fields.
- **No `@db.Decimal`** — use `Float` or `String` for money, convert with `decimal.js` in code.
- JSON fields stored as `String` with `JSON.stringify/parse`.

### Calculations
- Always use `decimal.js` for money arithmetic — never native JS floats.
- India defaults: 6% inflation, 3.33% withdrawal rate (vs US 4%), life expectancy 85.
- FIRE corpus gap accounts for FV of both existing lump-sum corpus AND existing monthly contributions.
- Tax slabs are FY 2025-26 (Budget 2025). New regime 87A rebate threshold = ₹12,00,000. New regime surcharge capped at 25%.

## Coding Conventions

### React Native / Mobile

- **Placeholders** — always set `placeholderTextColor="#9CA3AF"` on every `TextInput` with a `placeholder` prop.
- **Tab screen data fetching** — use `useFocusEffect(useCallback(() => { load(); }, []))`, never bare `useEffect(fn, [])`. Bottom tabs keep screens mounted, so `useEffect` only runs once and won't refresh when the user returns to the tab.
- **After any mutation** — after saving or deleting an investment (or any data that affects FIRE/health), fire background recalculations so dependent screens show fresh data on next focus:
  ```typescript
  fireApi.calculate().catch(() => {});
  healthScoreApi.calculate().catch(() => {});
  ```
- **OTP inputs** — do not set `maxLength` on individual digit boxes. The browser enforces `maxLength` before `onChangeText` fires, silently breaking paste. The controlled `value={digit}` already limits display.
- **Edit screens pattern** — load existing data in `useEffect`, pre-fill state, call the update API on save, then `navigation.goBack()`. Show `ActivityIndicator` while initial data loads.
- **Navigation typing** — always type navigation props with the correct stack params, e.g. `NativeStackScreenProps<MainStackParams, 'EditGoals'>`. Never use untyped `any` for navigation.
- **New screens in MainStack** — any screen that pushes on top of the tab bar must be added to `MainStack` in `AppNavigator.tsx`, not inside `MainTabNavigator`.
- **Error handling** — all API errors must show a user-visible `Alert`. Never silently swallow errors with only `console.error`.
- **Parallel data fetching** — when a screen needs multiple independent API calls, use `Promise.allSettled` so a single failure doesn't block the rest:
  ```typescript
  const [fireRes, healthRes, allocRes] = await Promise.allSettled([...]);
  ```

### Styling

- Brand green: `#1B4332` (primary buttons, active states, filled inputs)
- Light green bg: `#F0FDF4` (recommendation cards, comparison boxes)
- Border default: `#D1D5DB`, border active/filled: `#1B4332`
- Text primary: `#111827`, text secondary: `#6B7280`, text disabled/hint: `#9CA3AF`
- Card background: `#fff`, page background: `#F9FAFB`
- Destructive / error: `#EF4444`, warning / amber: `#F59E0B`, success: `#10B981`
- Border radius: 12–16 for cards, 8–10 for chips/badges
- All styles via `StyleSheet.create` — no inline style objects except for dynamic values (e.g. `{ flex: percentage }`)
- Elevation `1` on white cards for subtle shadow on Android/web

### Backend / NestJS

- **DTOs** — every controller endpoint must have a typed DTO with `class-validator` decorators. Never accept raw `body: any`.
- **Guards** — protected endpoints use `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)`. Public endpoints (send-otp, verify-otp, refresh-token) need no guard.
- **Error responses** — throw NestJS built-in exceptions (`UnauthorizedException`, `BadRequestException`, `NotFoundException`) — never `throw new Error(...)`.
- **Service layer** — all business logic in `*.service.ts`. Controllers are thin — only call service methods and return results.
- **Prisma** — always use `prisma.$transaction` for multi-step writes. Never do multi-step writes without a transaction.
- **Dev-only endpoints** — guard with `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') throw new ForbiddenException()`. Never expose dev shortcuts in production.
- **Override params pattern** — when adding what-if or scenario overrides to an existing endpoint, add optional fields to the DTO with sensible `@Min`/`@Max` bounds. Apply them in the service on top of the user's saved profile defaults.

### Financial Data

- **Never store raw PAN or Aadhaar** — store reference tokens only.
- **Phone numbers** — store in E.164 format (`+91XXXXXXXXXX`).
- **All monetary values** — use `decimal.js` for arithmetic; store as `Float` in SQLite, `Decimal` in PostgreSQL.
- **Tax year** — always label calculations with the financial year (e.g. FY 2025-26). Tax slabs change annually — keep them in a named config constant, never inline magic numbers.
- **Disclaimer** — every screen or report section showing projections or tax estimates must include: *"For educational purposes only. Not investment advice."*
- **Number formatting** — always use `toLocaleString('en-IN')` with ₹ prefix. For large values use Cr/L abbreviations (≥1 Cr → `₹X.XX Cr`, ≥1 L → `₹X.X L`).

### PDF Reports

- All report generation lives in `mobile/src/utils/generateReport.ts`.
- Fetch all data with `Promise.allSettled` — partial data renders with graceful fallback messages, never throws.
- Build HTML string → `Print.printToFileAsync({ html })` → `Sharing.shareAsync(uri)`.
- Check `Sharing.isAvailableAsync()` first; fall back to `Print.printAsync({ uri })` on simulator/web.
- Every report must include the standard disclaimer in the footer.

### Security

- Never log access tokens, refresh tokens, or OTPs to application logs in production.
- The `devOtp` field in `sendOtp` response must be gated on `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.
- Refresh tokens are bcrypt-hashed before storage. Never store plaintext refresh tokens.
- JWT expiry: access token 15 min, refresh token 30 days.

## Current Status (2026-03-25)

### Phase 1 — Completed ✅
- **Onboarding flow** — all 8 screens working end-to-end in web preview; inline form validation on all mandatory fields with red-border + error messages; post-OTP navigation bug fixed (new users now land on BasicProfile correctly)
- **Auth** — phone + OTP (dev auto-fill), JWT, refresh tokens, logout
- **Dashboard** — Health Score, FIRE progress ring, portfolio summary; refreshes on every tab focus
- **FIRE Calculator** — corpus, SIP target, adjustable assumptions; `useFocusEffect` for live refresh
- **FIRE What-If Scenarios** — three interactive levers (extra SIP, retire age, return rate); debounced API call; comparison box showing gap/SIP/age deltas vs baseline
- **Investments tab** — portfolio overview, asset allocation bar, per-investment cards
- **Add/Edit Investments** — `EditInvestmentScreen` with 14 instrument type chips, all fields, pre-fill on edit, delete with confirmation; triggers FIRE + health recalculation on save/delete
- **Tax Planner** — old vs new regime comparison, 80C tracker, deduction reference table
- **Tax calculation accuracy** — FY 2025-26 Budget 2025 slabs, 87A rebate at ₹12L for new regime, marginal relief, 25% surcharge cap for new regime
- **FIRE calculation accuracy** — corpus gap deducts FV of existing monthly SIPs; matches ET Money output
- **Profile tab** — financial summary, Edit Details section
  - EditPersonal, EditFinancials, EditGoals — all pre-filled from API
- **PDF Report Export** — one-tap export from Profile; covers health score, FIRE projections, portfolio, tax comparison; shares via native share sheet
- **UI polish** — grey placeholders, `useFocusEffect` on all tab screens

### Phase 2 — Completed ✅
- **Razorpay Subscriptions** ✅ — `SubscriptionsModule`, `SubscriptionOrder` model, `PremiumGuard`, `SubscriptionScreen` with monthly/annual plan cards; dev-activate bypass for local testing (PR #5)
- **Push Notifications** ✅ — `NotificationsModule`, `PushToken` + `NotificationPreference` + `NotificationLog` models, token registration/deregistration, preferences GET/PUT, notification log endpoint; daily drift alert cron (09:00 IST) with equity % vs risk-appetite target comparison; weekly 80C tax reminder cron (Monday 10:00 IST); Expo push delivery via `https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send` (PR #8)
- **CAMS / KFintech MF Import** ✅ — `MfImportModule`, `MfImportSession` model, flexible CAS CSV parser (CAMS/KFintech/MFCentral), multipart upload endpoint, review + confirm upsert into `Investment`; 3-step mobile wizard with per-fund type override; `↑ Import` button on Investments tab (PR #12)

### Phase 2 — Remaining (build in this order)
1. **CDSL / NSDL Demat Sync** — via Account Aggregator EQUITIES FI type (preferred) or direct CAS upload fallback; `DematSyncRequest` model
2. **Account Aggregator Auto-Sync** — full ReBIT AA consent flow (Finvu / OneMoney); requires FIU registration before production; `AaConsent` model; periodic Bull queue sync

> **Regulatory note:** WealthPath is a personal finance dashboard — not an investment advisor. No SEBI RIA license is required. The only regulatory overhead in Phase 2 is FIU registration for Account Aggregator (Feature 2), which can be deferred until after Feature 1 is live and validated.

---

### Phase 3 — Product Improvements (prioritised)

#### P1 — Fix gaps that actively hurt the experience ✅
1. **Insurance input & health score fix** ✅ — `InsuranceCover` model; `InsuranceModule` (GET/PUT `/insurance/me`); `InsuranceScreen` with term + health cover toggles, sum assured, premium fields; health score `scoreInsurance()` now uses real data (0–100 vs hardcoded 50); "Insurance Coverage" entry in Profile → Edit Details (PR #16)
2. **80C optimizer** ✅ — `GET /tax/profile` endpoint added; `EditTaxProfileScreen` with salary, HRA, 80C manual input, 80D, 80CCD(1B), home loan interest; live 80C progress bar + "invest X more to max out" tip; "Edit Profile" button on Tax Planner screen (PR #16)
3. **Corpus gap framing** ✅ — Dashboard FIRE card now shows "Invest ₹X/mo to reach your FIRE goal by age Y" as primary CTA; gap de-emphasised to secondary grey label; on-track state shows green confirmation (PR #16)

#### P2 — High-value new features
4. **Goal-based planner** — users define 2–3 financial goals alongside FIRE (e.g. "Buy house in 5 years — need ₹40L", "Child's education in 8 years — need ₹25L"); each goal gets a corpus target, timeline, and dedicated SIP calculation; `FinancialGoal` model on backend; new Goals tab or section under FIRE Calculator
5. **Net worth timeline chart** — monthly portfolio value stored as a snapshot on each recalculation; render as a line chart (last 6–12 months); the single most motivating retention feature in any personal finance app; `PortfolioSnapshot` model on backend
6. **Emergency fund tracker** — dedicated screen to set a target (e.g. 6× monthly expenses), track current liquid savings, show progress bar and shortfall; the health score already penalises users for this but there's no way to fix it in the app

#### P3 — Depth features
7. **Debt payoff screen** — list each loan (home, car, personal) with outstanding balance, interest rate, and remaining tenure; show "pay this off first" recommendation (highest-rate first = avalanche method) with projected interest saved; `Loan` model on backend
8. **SIP vs lump sum clarity** — in investment cards distinguish between monthly SIP contributions and existing corpus clearly; a ₹12L MF with ₹25K/mo SIP is very different from a ₹12L FD sitting idle; affects how FIRE gap is communicated
